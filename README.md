### Guidelines

The purpose of this repository is to have a documentation about every alert shipped by platforms. In the long run, we are aiming to support as many platforms as possible. If possible try to ensure the 'Diagnosis/Mitigation' sections are applicable to all critical alerts.

The primary target for these runbooks are folks who are novices and don't have much insight into what to do with alerts shipped in platforms. As a result, try to avoid excessive jargon and abbreviations.
